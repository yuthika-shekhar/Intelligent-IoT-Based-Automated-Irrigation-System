# Abstract

Agriculture has a major impact on economy of the country. Lot of Research been carried out in automating the irrigation system by employing wireless sensor and mobile computing. Also research been done in applying machine learning in agricultural system too. 

Recently “Machine to machine (M2M)” communicationn is an emerging technology which allows devices, objects etc tocommunicate among each other and send data to Server or
Cloud through the Core Network. So accordingly we here have developed an Intelligent IoT based Automated Irrigation system where sensor data pertaining to soil moisture and temperature captured and accordingly KNN (K- Nearest Neighbor) classification machine learning algorithm deployed for analyzing the sensor data for prediction towards irrigating the soil with water.

This is a fully automated where devices communicate among themselves and apply the intelligence in irrigating. This has been developed using low cost embedded devices like Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi3.
